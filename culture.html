      <h2>Classroom Culture Shock</h2>
      <p>Back home, classrooms felt like temples of quiet determination—chalk squeaking, fans whirring overhead, everyone jotting notes in synchrony. Here, the first lecture exploded with raised hands before the professor even finished the slide.
            “Hold on, why would that algorithm be O(n log n) and not linear?” someone challenged from the back row. I froze—debating a professor mid-sentence would be borderline rebellious in my high-school physics class. Yet the instructor grinned, pivoted to the whiteboard, and handed the marker to the student.
            My pulse sprinted. When the professor later asked, “Any other questions?”, an inner voice murmured You risk nothing by wondering out loud. I raised my hand, words wobbling but visible: “Could you walk through a smaller input first?” Heads nodded. After class a senior whispered, “Great question, helped me too.” I walked out taller, realizing curiosity was the new currency—and I’d been richer than I thought.</p>

      <h2>First Snow Day ❄️</h2>

      <p>The forecast promised “flurries.” I pictured confetti. Instead, the sky dumped powdered sugar on everything in sight. Ignoring every winter-prep email, I barreled outside in flip-flops, hoodie flapping like a flag of defiance. Within seconds my toes were popsicles.
            A friend sprinted over, brandishing wool socks and shouting, “You’ll thank me later!” We traded footwear right there on the sidewalk, laughing at the absurdity. Snowflakes paired with campus floodlights looked like thousands of camera flashes.
            We built a crooked snowman using dining-hall lids for eyes and pretzel sticks for arms. A passing guitarist provided a soundtrack of out-of-tune carols. For a moment, every assignment, visa worry, and currency-conversion headache dissolved. The cold bit hard, but the novelty tasted warm—proof that wonder still visits, even when you’re shivering in borrowed boots.</p>

      <h2>Dining Hall Tales</h2>
      <p>Steam from giant metal trays fogged my glasses as I inched through the lunch line. The label read “Curry (Mild).” I chuckled—mild was doing a lot of work there. The student behind me eyed the dish. “Spicy curry? It’s from India, right?”
            I nodded, adding, “Back home my aunt would call this baby food.” We both laughed, and he dared me to doctor it with the dining hall’s lone bottle of Sriracha. I countered by whipping out a pocket-sized packet of garam masala my mom had tucked in my suitcase “for emergencies.”
            At the table, we traded culinary war stories—his failed attempt at kimchi pancakes, my disastrous first mac-and-cheese. Two more students joined, curious about the aroma curling from our plates. Soon we were rating cafeteria hacks: mixing hot chocolate into coffee, sprinkling cinnamon on sweet-potato fries, stealth-toasting marshmallows over the pizza oven’s open flame.
            The meal ended with an invitation: “Come over Saturday—we’re hosting an international potluck. Bring anything that tastes like home.” I walked away already planning a make-shift biryani, grateful that comfort food speaks every language, especially when shared across wobbling plastic tables.</p>
