      <h2>Financial Aid Story</h2>
      <p>Financial Aid Story
        My financial-aid adventure began with a dreaded “incomplete file” email two weeks before tuition was due. I stared at the screen, pulse racing—one missing PDF could freeze my registration. Swallowing panic, I drafted a polite note:
        
        Subject: Missing Scholarship Form—Request for Guidance
        Body:
        Hello Ms. Ramirez,
        I noticed my Scholarship B form hasn’t been processed. Could you please resend the secure upload link so I can submit it today? Thank you for your time.
        —Vennela.
        
        Eight minutes later (record response!), she replied with the link and an encouraging “Don’t worry, it happens.” I uploaded the file, checked my portal, and let out a victory whoop when the hold disappeared. The episode taught me two lessons: first, administrative snafus are normal; second, well-timed politeness can move mountains—sometimes in under ten minutes.

      <h2>Campus Contacts</h2>
      <p>nternational Students & Scholars Office (ISSO) – They’re the backstage crew for your immigration status. I once walked in clutching a stack of I-20s like trading cards; an advisor highlighted the correct signature line and soothed my fears about travel signatures in under five minutes.

        Counseling Center – A friend noticed my third all-nighter in a row and asked, “Need mental-health resources?” I admitted I was overwhelmed. She walked me to the center’s front desk, where they handed me a stress-ball shaped like a brain and scheduled a same-week appointment. Turns out talking is cheaper than espresso shots.
        
        Career Services – Mr. Thompson rewrote my cover-letter greeting (“Dear Sir/Madam” → “Hello Hiring Team at JBS Foods”) and flagged a grammar mistake I’d missed for months. He also tipped me off to free LinkedIn headshots each semester—yes, professional lighting, no awkward selfie stick.
        
        Peer Tutoring Hub – Don’t wrestle Calc III alone. Drop-ins happen nightly; tutors accept payment in gratitude and Dad jokes. My tutor once diagrammed triple integrals using salt-shaker props from the dining hall—unforgettable and exam-saving.
        
        Together these offices form an unofficial survival network: when in doubt, pick one door and walk through it. Someone will point you to the next right place—sometimes with chocolate, always with a smile.
        
        </p>
      <p><strong>Friend:</strong> “Need mental health resources?”<br>
         <strong>Me:</strong> “Yes, I’m feeling overwhelmed.”<br>
         <strong>Friend:</strong> “Drop by the counseling center; it’s a safe space.”</p>
