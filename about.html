      <h2>How It All Began</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in India, I grew up celebrating vibrant festivals, sharing meals with family, and dreaming big. Small alleys echoed with laughter during Holi, and my grandmother’s stories painted each morning with hope.
            Every Sunday my dad and I would walk to the corner tea stall, dodging rickshaws while arguing about whether physics or cricket mattered more in life. “Both,” he’d say, patting my shoulder. “I just want you to chase whatever lights you up.” Those words stuck. I spent late nights on the roof with a notebook, tracing airline routes in the stars and promising myself I’d board one of those flights someday, even if I didn’t yet know where it was headed.</p>

      <h2>Leaving Home</h2>

      <p>That suitcase carousel felt like the point of no return. Clutching my passport, I whispered to myself, I can do this. A farewell hug from Mom lingered in my mind as I stepped into unknown skies.
            Thirty-eight hours, two layovers, and one lost boarding pass later, I landed in the Midwest—a place my geography teacher once described as “flat, cold, and full of corn.” At customs an officer asked, “Purpose of your visit?” My voice trembled: “Stud… student—Computer Science.” He stamped the passport with a thud that sounded like a gong; suddenly the dream was official and terrifying.
            Outside, brisk air slapped my cheeks. Snowflakes drifted like tiny confetti, and for a second I forgot my nerves and tried to catch one on my tongue—an impromptu celebration of making it this far.</p>

      <h2>First Conversation</h2>
      <p>On my first campus dinner, a friendly face said, “Try the cornbread—it’s our staple!” Hesitant, I took a bite and smiled, realizing that every shared meal bridged worlds and hearts.
            We sat at a long wooden table under buzzing fluorescent lights, plastic trays squeaking against the surface. “So what’s your real name?” he asked after slaughtering my first attempt at introducing myself. I repeated it slowly, then wrote it on a napkin. He practiced until he got the rolled r right, cheering when he finally nailed it.
            In return, I tested my tongue on words like “y’all” and “pop” instead of “soda.” By dessert (a mysterious neon-green Jell-O), we were already planning a study session. That exchange taught me that language is less about perfect pronunciation and more about the willingness to look a little silly together.</p>

      <h2>Roommate Reunion</h2>
      <p>Late at night, my roommate blinked sleepily: “Night owl, huh?” We laughed, swapping stories of late-night study marathons and morning chai rituals, forging a bond beyond borders.
            He showed me how to microwave popcorn without burning it; I taught him to make masala Maggi noodles in one pot. When homesickness hit—usually around 2 a.m.—we’d sit on the floor, him strumming a beat-up guitar, me scrolling through photos of home. On Diwali he stuck fairy lights above our desks and taped a hand-drawn sign: Happy Festival of Lights! In return, I dragged him out into the snow for his first impromptu rangoli attempt (it looked more like abstract art, but the effort meant everything).</p>
