      <h2>Keeping My Roots Alive</h2>
      <p>Two weeks before Diwali, I raided the local dollar store for anything resembling marigold garlands. The cashier raised an eyebrow when I bought eight sets of battery-powered fairy lights, a bag of tea-lights, and enough orange crepe paper to wrap an elephant. Back in my dorm, I lined the window with paper “flowers,” twisting the wire lights through them until the glass glowed saffron and gold.
            That evening my roommate wandered in, transfixed. “What’s the celebration?” she asked, balancing a microwaved burrito. “It’s Diwali—our festival of lights,” I explained, describing how fireworks streak across my hometown sky, how we paint rangoli at sunrise, and how the smell of ghee lamps clings to everything for days.
            We lit the tea-lights, turned off the overhead fluorescents, and let the room fill with flickering warmth. She pressed her palms together in an awkward namaste; I laughed and taught her the real gesture. For one night, homesickness stepped aside, replaced by the quiet assurance that traditions can migrate too—and they’re even brighter when shared.

      <h2>Finding Community</h2>
      <p>I discovered the South Asian Student Association by accident—lured by the aroma of samosas drifting from the student-org fair. Inside, Bollywood remixes thumped through cheap speakers, and henna artists wielded cones like calligraphy pens.
            A senior in a crimson kurta waved me over. “Hey, fresher! You’re one of us now,” she declared, pinning a glittery badge onto my jacket. Within minutes I was practicing garba steps with strangers, our feet sketching spirals on the hardwood floor.
            Later that night we sprawled on the grass, sweat cooling in the autumn air. A Pakistani guitarist strummed “Pasoori,” and everyone chimed in, stumbling over the Urdu lyrics but laughing at the effort. As glow sticks faded to pale green, I realized community isn’t always inherited; sometimes you build it from shared playlists, borrowed kurtas, and the collective ache of missing home. Distance shrank, replaced by a single heartbeat set to a dhol’s rhythm.</p>

      <h2>Personal Traditions</h2>
      <p>Every Sunday at 4 p.m. sharp, my dorm room transforms into a miniature chai stall. A dented saucepan becomes the cauldron; cardamom pods crack under the back of a spoon; ginger hisses when it meets rolling milk.
            The ritual started as self-care—one mug to chase away Iowa’s gray winters—but friends soon sniffed out the scent of spices and drifted in. We perch on mismatched desk chairs and laundry hampers, passing around hot glasses that fog our glasses.
            Stories unspool with the steam: Yi recalls Lunar New Year firecrackers, Omar describes desert sunsets that taste of dates, Maria laughs about her abuela’s secret flan recipe. We joke that the chai gains a new “flavor note” with every tale—wanderlust, nostalgia, grit.
            When the pot runs dry, we clink our glasses in a silent toast. Some traditions survive across oceans intact; others morph into hybrid customs, stitched together by friendship. Either way, each sip reminds me that culture isn’t something you carry alone—it’s something you ladle out, refill, and share, Sunday after Sunday.
