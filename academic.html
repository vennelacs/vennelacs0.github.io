      <h2>Speaking Up in Class</h2>
      <p>On the third week of Algorithms, Professor Anders paused in front of a wall of Greek symbols and said, “Any volunteers to walk us through the proof?” Silence ballooned. My chest thumped like a festival drum. You promised one question—or answer—per week, I reminded myself, fingers tingling.
            I rose so fast my chair squeaked. Eyes converged. The marker felt slick with panic, but my voice steadied as I traced the inductive step. Halfway through I fumbled a minus sign; a classmate murmured the correction, and I nodded, folding his insight into the explanation.
            When I finally set the marker down, the room broke into applause—not thunderous, more like polite rain, yet every clap echoed yes, you belong here. After class a senior high-fived me. “Took me a year to do that,” she said. I laughed, cheeks warm, realizing confidence isn’t the absence of fear—it’s the decision to stand anyway, marker in hand, and trust that someone will catch your dropped minus signs.

      <h2>Late-Night Study Group</h2>
      <p>The campus café closed hours ago, but our makeshift command center in the residence-hall lounge was buzzing. Maria slid a fresh pot of drip coffee onto the table, whispering, “Pass the notes, please.” Omar stacked flashcards like poker chips, challenging anyone to a quick-sort showdown.
            At 2:17 a.m. our collective brain hit a logic wall. I doodled flowcharts that looked more like subway maps; Yi tapped his pencil against the table in rhythmic frustration. Suddenly Maria squinted at the whiteboard: “What if we treat the base case as a sentinel node?” We froze, then erupted—that was the missing link.
            We spent the next hour rewriting the proof, high on discovery and caffeine. Outside, a freight train howled; inside, Omar drummed an improvised victory riff on an empty ramen bowl. By sunrise our yawns turned into cheers as the final line of code compiled without errors. We staggered to the window, faces lit peach-orange by dawn, and someone whispered, “Teamwork algorithm: proven correct.”
            I crawled into bed two hours later, exhausted yet electrified. Grades mattered, sure, but that moment—friends transformed into co-conspirators against unsolved problems—felt like the real diploma tucked into my heart’s back pocket.
